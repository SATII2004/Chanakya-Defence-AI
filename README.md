**C.H.A.N.A.K.Y.A.** is a next-generation **Integrated Command & Control System (ICCS)** designed for modern hybrid warfare. It serves as a centralized, glass-morphic dashboard connecting the **Chief of Defence Staff (CDS)** with **Field Agents** in real-time, utilizing Generative AI for strategic advantage.

## 🚀 Strategic Capabilities

### **1. 🗺️ 3D Kinetic Battlespace**
* **Live Asset Tracking:** Real-time visualization of all 17 Indian Command HQs (Army, Navy, Air Force) on a 3D terrain.
* **Dual-Layer Rendering:** Utilizes PyDeck Scatterplots + Text Layers to ensure icons (🛡️, ✈️, ⚓) are visible under any condition.
* **Threat Plotting:** Automatically plots hostile intel reports as pulsating Red Skulls on the map.

### **2. 🧠 AI Commander (Gemini 1.5 Pro)**
* **Tactical Advisor:** Acts as a virtual Chief of Staff, analyzing complex intel situations and suggesting operational courses of action.
* **VEDA (Vector Encrypted Document Analysis):** Instantly parses classified PDF briefs to extract logistics and threat data.

### **3. 🗣️ "Jarvis" Neural Voice**
* **Deep Command Voice:** Integrates **Microsoft Edge TTS** (`en-IN-PrabhatNeural`) to speak responses in a deep, authoritative Indian military accent.
* **Pitch Shift Tech:** Custom audio processing lowers pitch by `-15Hz` for a realistic "War Room" experience.

### **4. 🌐 OSINT Radar**
* **Social Listening:** Scans simulated public frequencies (Twitter/News) for keywords like "Explosion" or "Troop Movement".
* **AI Truth Check:** A dedicated module to verify rumors and misinformation using cross-referencing algorithms.

### **5. 👁️ Trinetra (Satellite Recon)**
* **Computer Vision:** Analyzes uploaded drone or satellite imagery using Multimodal AI.
* **Target Lock:** Identifies assets, terrain risks, and enemy concealment from images.

### **6. 🚨 Kinetic Alerts**
* **HTML5 Audio Injection:** Bypasses browser restrictions to force-play a "Nuclear Alarm" siren when a **CRITICAL** threat is detected.
* **Visual Pulse:** The UI flashes red during high-DEFCON states.
